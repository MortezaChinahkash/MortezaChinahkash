# 👋 Hi, I'm Morteza Chinahkash

I'm an aspiring **Front-End Web Developer** based in Germany 🇩🇪, currently enrolled in the **Frontend Developer Bootcamp at Developer Akademie** (Jan–Jul 2025).

💻 Right now, I'm focused on building interactive, user-friendly web applications using modern frontend technologies.  
🚀 In parallel, I'm learning **Java** and preparing to dive into **Spring Boot** to expand my skills into backend development.

I love turning ideas into clean, responsive, and accessible web experiences — whether it’s a simple landing page or a dynamic single-page app. I enjoy working in teams, writing clean code, and learning something new every day.

## 🧠 What I'm Learning

- ✅ Building over 12 hands-on projects as part of the Developer Akademie curriculum
- ✅ Learning frontend technologies like **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Angular, Vue, TypeScript & RxJS**
- ✅ Deepening my understanding of modern styling tools like **SASS/SCSS**, **Bootstrap**, **Material Design**, and **Tailwind CSS**
- ✅ Currently self-studying **Java** and preparing to use **Spring Boot** for backend APIs and full-stack integration
